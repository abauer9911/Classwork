    "## Instructions:\n",
    "Use this Thanksgiving dataset to explore patterns in the family dining habits.\n",
    "You’ll need to _**interpret**_ the data using summary statistics, **not just report them**.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will being using **only the describe function** to answer your questions\n",
    "\n",
    "### Questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Looking at the minimum and maximum values of Age, what do they suggest about who attended this Thanksgiving dinner? <br>\n",
    "**Answer:** <br>\n",
    "- The Minimum age is nine while the Maximum is 72. This suggests that both kids and adults attended the dinner, most likely across multiple generations such as grandparents, parents, and children. There is no extremely young children so we can assume that either this family does not have any very young children, or if they do, those children did not attend the dinner.\n",
    "2. Looking at the mean and standard deviation of Dinner_Duration, what do they show about how consistent the mealtime was across family members? <br>\n",
    "**Answer:** <br>\n",
    "- We can see by our Dinner_Duration variable (which is in hours), that the mean is 2.504 hours with a standard deviation of 0.56531 hours. This shows that most dinners were fairly consistent with a standard deviation of just over thirty minutes.\n",
    "3. If someone stayed for 4.8 hours, would you consider them an outlier? _Use the mean and standard deviation to support your answer (Hint: $mean + 2*std$ OR $IQR=Q3−Q1$ and $Upper Bound=Q3+1.5×IQR$)._ <br>\n",
    "**Answer:** <br>\n",
    "- 4.8 hours would be an outlier because 3.9499999999999993 hours is the upper bound using the equations provided\n",
    "4. Compare the mean and median of Dinner_Servings. What could a large difference between them indicate about family member behavior? _(Hint: 50% is half way in the data set)_ <br>\n",
    "**Answer:** <br>\n",
    "- The median of the Dinner_Servings variable is 4.0, while the mean is 3.92. This is not a large difference, but if there was a large difference it would suggest the pressence of an outlier in the data (where someone either ate a very small or large amount of servings)\n",
    "5. Looking at the max value of Dessert_Servings, what type of guest do you imagine that might be and what could this tell us about dessert consumption overall?  <br>\n",
    "**Answer:** <br>\n",
    "- The max Dessert_Servings is 3.0 while the mean and median are both 1.5. This suggest those who eat the max amount of dessert servings are eating twice as much as the average guest. The average Dessert serving being 1.5 makes sense, especially with it being a holiday where people may tend to eat more than normal.\n",
    "6. Suppose the standard deviation of Dinner_Serving is small. What does that suggest about how much everyone ate?  <br>\n",
    "**Answer:** <br>\n",
    "- If the standard deviation of Dinner_servings is small, that suggests most guests ate about the same amount of servings with not a lot of variation in the servings eaten.\n",
    "7. Which statistic (min, max, mean, std) best helps you find the “light eaters”? Explain how you would identify them and if the minimum makes sense.<br>\n",
    "**Answer:** <br>\n",
    "- The Min would help you find the \"light eaters\" because this is the value of the least amount of servings eaten by the guest. The value provided for this is 3.0, so we would filter for the guests who ate 3 servings of dinner. This value is relative to the data we are given and the classification of \"light eater\" would vary if we look at a different dataset instead, so for this family, being a \"light eater\" would be anyone who eats the minimum number of dinner servings which is 3.\n",
    "8. The range (max − min) of Dinner_Duration is quite large. What could that imply about how the dinner was organized?  <br>\n",
    "**Answer:** <br>\n",
    "- This could imply that some people were only able to stay for a portion of the dinner (one hour) while some people stayed longer (with a max of 3.5 hours). This could possibly be attributed to the children going to bed after they eat and the adults staying up to talk and drink, or other such social events tied to the dinner.\n",
    "9. You suspect that older guests tend to eat fewer desserts. Could you use only the `describe` function to explore whether that idea might be true before doing a full analysis or would we have to include something else?  <br>\n",
    "**Answer:** <br>\n",
    "- To do that type of analysis another variable would have to be added, to filter for the older guests. Using only the `describe` function, we can not do this analysis because the dessert_servings variable includes the data from all guests, not just the older guests.\n",
    "10. What does the mean tell you about how common it was for people to watch the Macy’s Day Parade?  <br>\n",
    "**Answer:** <br>\n",
    "- The mean tells you the probability that someone would be likely to watch the Macy's Day Parade (in our case someone is 68% likely to watch the parade).\n",
    "11. what does the standard deviation suggest about the variation in watching behavior? Was parade-watching behavior fairly consistent across people, or was there a lot of difference between individuals?  <br>\n",
    "**Answer:** <br>\n",
    "- The standard deviation is quite large for this value (at 0.471212), so that suggests that there is a good amount of variation between individual people if they watch the parade or not.\n",
    "12. In one sentence, summarize what kind of Thanksgiving this dataset represents. Focus on what the numbers imply rather than just stating the numbers.  <br>\n",
    "**Answer:** <br>\n",
    "- This data set takes an analysis of a family of fifty during their Thanksgiving dinner across age groups and various variables such as the servings of dinner and dessert, if they watched the parade, and how long they stayed.\n",
    "13. Suggest some visuals that would be ideal for exploring this data and state their purpose. <br>\n",
    "**Answer:** <br>\n",
    "- We could look at a scatter plot comparing the Dinner_Servings and Dinner_Duration to see the relationship between those who stayed and those who had more food to see if they were just fast eaters or if they stayed longer in order to have more food.\n",
    "- We could look at a scatter plot comparing the age of the guest with their dessert_servings to analyze if the older guests have more dessert.\n",
    "- We could look at the Dinner_Servings and the Dessert_Servings to see if those who had more or less dinner had more or less dessert."
